# Logo Fix Summary - Server URLs

## ✅ **Fixed with Correct Server URLs**

### 1. **Created manifest.json**

- Using your server URLs: `https://thinkvelocity.in/next-assets/`
- Proper PWA configuration for Google Business Panel

### 2. **Added Multiple Icon Sizes**

- 16x16, 32x32, 192x192, 512x512 pixel versions
- All pointing to your server-hosted images

### 3. **Enhanced Favicon Support**

- Multiple link tags for better browser compatibility
- Apple touch icon for iOS devices

## 🎯 **Why Your Logo Wasn't Showing**

The main issue was the **missing manifest.json file**. Google Business Panel requires:

1. ✅ **Valid manifest.json** (now created)
2. ✅ **Multiple icon sizes** (now added)
3. ✅ **Proper structured data** (already correct)
4. ✅ **Accessible images** (your server URLs work)

## 📋 **Files Updated**

1. **`public/manifest.json`** - NEW FILE with server URLs
2. **`src/app/layout.js`** - Added multiple icon sizes

## 🚀 **Expected Timeline**

- **Immediate**: Better favicon display in browsers
- **1-3 days**: Google re-crawls manifest.json
- **1-2 weeks**: Logo appears in Google Business Panel

## 🔍 **Verification**

Test these URLs to confirm they work:

- ✅ `https://thinkvelocity.in/manifest.json`
- ✅ `https://thinkvelocity.in/next-assets/VEL_LOGO2.png`
- ✅ `https://thinkvelocity.in/next-assets/Velocity_SEO_Logo.png`

Your logo should now appear in Google search results! 🎉
